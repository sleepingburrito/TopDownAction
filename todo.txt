walls
    -fix colltions (double check it) (polish)
    -make checks for low speed
    -make min bounc speed and wall hugging if under

start working on a player object
    -play with recoil (like if you can make the physics do it)
    -gets and sets for player
    -reset player


game scene
    -loading level from file
    -holds all sene objects


make random
    array 1 to 1000

    tickSeed
    lastValue
    currentIndex
    timesCalledLeft

    if (timesCalledLeft = 0)
        currentin = 0
        timesCalledLeft = RND_MAX
    else
        currentIndex = (tickseed ^ timesCalledLeft + lastValue) % timesCalledLeft

    choose a number randomly in the list, between 0 and timesCalledLeft
    swap index with the last value and lower the range by 1
    timesCalledLeft -= 1
